## Mutt

This mutt config uses gmail imap and smtp with some security encryption with gpg. For GMail just set the "my_*" variables in muttrc and you are done (in case of using other email servers this can be done with some simple changes). 

## mpv

My mpv configuration contains the following scripts:

- [playlistmanager.lua](https://github.com/jonniek/mpv-playlistmanager)
- [webm.lua](https://github.com/ekisu/mpv-webm)

The shaders configuration that I'am using are from [Argon Github Repository](https://github.com/Argon-/mpv-config).
